    "## Why it is important to handle missing values in a dataset before analysis or modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Maintains Data Integrity\n",
    "Missing values can skew statistical summaries like mean, median, standard deviation, and correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignoring them might result in biased insights from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Prevents Errors in Algorithms\n",
    "Most machine learning algorithms cannot handle missing values directly and will throw errors or crash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models like Linear Regression, SVM, or KNN expect complete data for all features.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3. Ensures Accurate Model Training\n",
    "Missing values can introduce noise or bias, reducing model accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models trained on incomplete data may fail to generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    " 4. Improves Visualization and Exploration\n",
    "Visualizations may become incomplete or misleading if missing values are not handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, missing values in a column may affect histogram shapes or scatter plot density.\n",
    "\n",
    " 5. Allows Better Decision-Making\n",
    "In real-world applications (healthcare, finance, etc.), decisions based on incomplete or flawed analysis can be costly or dangerous.\n",
